Disassembled code of the CL300 controller from the IVT Greenline Compact 8 heat pump (year of production: circa 2000)

Out of curiosity I tried to disassemble code of the mentioned controller.

The hardware (electronics of the controller) is not so much complicated - main MCU is Philips 80C552, most of the
controlled/checked hardware is connected via buffer CMOS logic. The pomp has a simple panel to control it, the
communication here is with a couple of shift registers.

It's an old pump and controller (it's almost impossible to buy a new one these days), so I assume I don't violate
any copyrights with publishing this.
